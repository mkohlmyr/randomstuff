# RIP

This repository contains the code for a simple javascript based code editor. It was built on CodeMirror, node-webkit and React.

I still very much like the ui approach (all shortcuts based) as well as the look and feel. Perhaps at some point this will be re-implemented using electron, now that more mature platforms are available for building native javascript applications.

Alternatively I could see myself rebuilding it as a Chrome application backed by Google Drive or S3 or something to that effect since my daily driver at home is now a Chromebook.
